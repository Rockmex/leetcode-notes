## My solution:

If there is a cycle, then the loop will be endless and it will eventually going over the cycle infinite times. 

If there is no cycle, then the program will end after looping the LinkedList once.

Knowing this principle, we can use the <font size=4>**Fast-Slow Pointers**</font> algorithm. With the `slow` node moving 1 step and `fast` node moving 2 steps at a time, the two nodes will eventually meet at some time within the loop.

![Explanation](/images/Q141.explanation.PNG)

```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;
    while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow == fast){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Efficiency Analysis:
>Runtime: O(k), our solution is a linear solution using one `while` loop. k is the number for the `slow` and `fast` node to catch up.
>
>Memory: O(1), our solution did not use any additional data structure to store data.
