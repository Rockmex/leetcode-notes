## My solution:

According to the question, we are given the node to be deleted. So we cannot do normal skipping of the node.

The node is guarantee to not be the tail, so we can just copy the value of the next node to the current node and skip the next node.

```java
public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
}
```
